# Using a push button as input and an LED as output, 
# you will enter number (0-9) in Morse Code.
# The LED will echo each dot or dash as you press and the 
# decoded digits will be printed on your terminial

# Short press (0.4 seconds or less) = dot
# Long press (more than 0.4 seconds) = dash

# LED should echo after each press 
# (short blink for dot, longer blink for dash)

# If you pause for at least one second between taps
# program will treat as end and decode number

# Longer pause of two seconds or more should insert a space 
# between digits

# Define button, Pi pin number GPIO27 
# Default pull_up = True (default HIGH, press = LOW)
